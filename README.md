# General Information
Manages .dat files for unturned modding, makes life a little easier hopefully
It's current state makes it barely usable, practical or sensible to be quite honest.

# Logging
It can log IDs and other data from already made .dat files, inculding the vanilla-made .dat files.
It then puts all of the information in csv files, separating ID, Bundle name, In-game name, filepath to the bundle's folder and wether it is a cosmetic or not.
I'm working on adding file-per-type functionality but it's proven to be a pain in the butt for someone as smol brained as I am.

# Generation
This version being a total WIP can only generate .dat files for vehicles, because it is what I'm mostly used to using and felt more comfortable weorking with.

# Special thanks to
iDrmzIt for the original idea
Nelson Sexton for making .dat files only slightly painful to work with
Mitsuha Miyamizu for being a general purpose goddess
