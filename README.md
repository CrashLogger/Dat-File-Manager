# Dat-File-Manager
Manages .dat files for unturned modding, makes life a little easier hopefully

It was designed to make my and craven's life easier when creating the Unturned II vehicles mod for Unturned 3 (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2193789780) and it sure as hell did the trick.

There were plans initially to expand upon this, but we realised how utterly useless it would be for most cases.
This is a very convenient program for large amounts of vehicles that just change in color or other minor model changes.

It will require a color list so that it knows what prefix/suffix use for each color.

Regular bundle support was initially planned, but since they have been deprecated by Nelson, I won't be adding onto that.

This program was meant for a one-use situation aswell as for learning windows Forms. Minor updates may follow but don't hold your breath.
